# File Handling - The process of creating, reading, writing, and manipulating files on a computer's file system
# open() - Takes two parameters (filename, mode)

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

If the file should be handled as binary or text mode:
-----------------------------------------------------
"t" - Text (default value) - Text mode
"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)
