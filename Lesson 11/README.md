Exceptions:
--------
- When the event occurs during program execution, it disrupts the normal flow of instructions
- When an error occurs 
  - Will normally stop and generate an error message
- try - Lets you test a block of code for errors
- except - Lets you handle the error (you can have many excepts)
- else - Lets you execute else code when there is no error
- finally - Lets you execute code, regardless of the result
- raise - Used to raise an exception
------------
Array:
------
- Used to store multiple elements (but not of the same types) in a single variable
- Similarities between list and array:
  - Sorting Data
  - Mutable
  - Indexing
  - Slicing Operations
- Differences between list and array:
  - List:
    - Different Datatypes
    - You can't do operations
    - Built-in
  - Array:
    - Similar Datatypes
    - You can do operations
    - numpy needed
- Advantages:
  - Less memory
  - Fast
  - Better when using math operations
