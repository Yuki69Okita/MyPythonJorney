Strings
-------
- –ê set of characters represented in pairs of single or double quotes (can be triple, for example, to quote something)
- It's going to be an error if there are 2 pairs of quotes with the same type in one string
-------------------------


String slices
-------------
- Each character in a string has an index that can be accessed
- The index starts at 0
- You can take any symbol from back to front
- You can get character set
- If you don't write a number, it takes default number
- You can save it in variable
- You can type negative and positive numbers (but some logic needed because it's not showing anything)
-------------------------



Formatting string
-----------------
- Concatenation string - concatenating strings end-to-end to create a new string ".." + aa + ".."
- Formatted string-  f".. {..} ... {..}"
