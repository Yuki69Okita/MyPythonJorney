Loops:
------

- while loop:
	- Executes a set of statements as long as a condition is true
	- break - Stops the loop even if the while condition is true
	- continue - Stops the current iteration, and continue with the next
	- else - Runs a block of code once when the condition no longer is true
--------

- for loop:
	- Used for iterating over a sequence:
		- list
			- Every element
		- tuple
			- Every element
		- dictionary
			- Only keys 
			- You can get keys values but need a func or somehting
		- set
			- Every element
		- string
			- Every character
		- range(start num, finish num, step)
	- break - Stops the loop even if the while condition is true
	- continue - Stops the current iteration, and continue with the next
	- else - When the loop is finished it will execute else
-----------

- Nested loops:
	- The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop"
------------

- Infinite loops:
	- A continuous repetitive conditional loop that gets executed until an external factor
-------------

Exercises:
----------

- Exercice 1 - Guessing game (With while)
	- Win number is going to be from 1 to 10
	- The user need to guess it
	- Three chances
	- Add a hint ("up" or "down")


- Exercise 2 - Car game (With while)
	- Four commands - help, start, stop and quit (not case-sensitive)
	- If the input is not one of the four commands - print "I don't understand"
	- If the car is started - you can't start it again
	- If the car is stopped - you can't stop it again


- Exercise 3 - Shopping cart (With for)
	- Create some prices
	- Calculate it
	- Print the result
 

- Exercise 4 - Print F with list (With for)
	- Use nested for loops
	- Use x
	- Use [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]
