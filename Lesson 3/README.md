The “input()” function:
-----------------------
- Takes the values from the user
- This function is called to tell the program to stop and wait for the user to enter the value
- This is a built-in feature
- User input is always converted to a string
-----------------------------------------------------


Implicit Type Conversion
------------------------
- The Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without any user involvement
------------------------------------------------------


Explicit Type Conversion
------------------------
- Тhe data type is manually changed by the user as per their requirement
- With explicit type conversion, there is a risk of data loss since we are forcing an expression to be changed in some specific data type

    - int(a, base)
        - This function converts any data type to integer
         - ‘Base’ specifies the base in which string is if the data type is a string
    - float()
        - This function is used to convert any data type to a floating-point number
    - ord()
        - This function is used to convert a character to integer
    - hex()
        - This function is to convert integer to hexadecimal string
    - oct()
        - This function is to convert integer to octal string
    - tuple()
        - This function is used to convert to a tuple
    - set()
        - This function returns the type after converting to set
    - list()
        - This function is used to convert any data type to a list type
    - dict()
        - This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key,value) into a dictionary
    - str()
        - Used to convert integer into a string
    - complex(real,imag)
        - This function converts real numbers to complex(real,imag) number
    - chr(number)
        - This function converts number to its corresponding ASCII character
